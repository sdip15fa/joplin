# FAQ

## What is Joplin Cloud?

[Joplin Cloud](https://joplincloud.com) allows you to synchronise your notes automatically to all your devices. Moreover, this service gives you access to additional features:

- Publish a note to the internet and share it with others. The published note will be updated automatically whenever you make a change.

- Collaborate on a notebook with other Joplin Cloud users. You can share a notebook with other users who will then have full access to it - they can read, change or add more notes, images or documents to the notebook. This is convenient to work on ideas or on a project with others.

- Improved sync performances. Compared to other sync options, Joplin Cloud, being developed specifically for Joplin, is faster and consumes less resources.

Moreover, by getting a subscription you are supporting the development of the project as a whole, including the open source applications. Such support is needed in the long term to provide bug and security fixes, add new features, and provide support.

## All our services are carbon neutral

<img style="max-width: 100%; float:right;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Assets/WebsiteAssets/images/plans/CarbonNeutral.png" /> Because the protection of the environment is as important as the protection of your data, we made our services carbon neutral. We believe that technology should not come at the expense of the planet, and we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint.<br/><br/>To do this, we invest in various ecological projects such as planting trees, cleaning up polluted areas, cleaning the oceans, and more, through organizations, associations, or companies. We constantly monitor our emissions and offset them through these projects to ensure that we are doing our part in the fight against climate change.<br/><br/>For example, we have teamed up with the non-profit organisation carbone.eco and invested in the reforestation of four hectares of forest in France.
